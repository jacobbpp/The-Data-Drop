# The Data Drop  
Turning messy data into real decisions

Welcome, developers and data folk. You have been drafted into a cross functional product team for a very important client. They are sitting on a mountain of data and want answers, insight and useful tools, not just pretty charts.

Your job for the day:

- Take a real world style dataset  
- Clean it, explore it  
- Build something people can actually use  

That could be a dashboard, a small app, an API, or a simple scenario explorer.

You do not need to be an expert. You do need to be curious, collaborative and ready to ship something by the end of the day.

## The Data Brief

On the day you will be given:

- A realistic, slightly messy dataset  
- A short client style brief that explains the scenario and the questions they care about  

Think things like customer behaviour, performance metrics or operational data. Your job is to turn raw data into insight and then into something your client could use in the real world.


## Challenge Tiers

### Tier 1: Clean and Explain

- Tidy the messy data  
- Document what you changed and why  
- Build clear, simple visuals that answer basic questions from the brief  

### Tier 2: Explore and Build

- Dig deeper into the data and look for more interesting patterns or stories  
- Build something interactive. For example:
  - A dashboard with filters and drill downs  
  - A small web app that lets a user explore key metrics  
  - An API that serves cleaned, useful data to other tools  

### Tier 3 (Optional): Scenarios and Recommendations

Tier 3 is about sharpening the story rather than adding heavy data science.

If your team is ready, you can:

- Pick two or three key decision questions from the client perspective, for example:
  - Which segment should we target with a new offer  
  - Where might we need to review a policy or product  
- Add simple “what if” or scenario views to your tool, such as:
  - Filters or toggles that highlight a target or at risk group  
  - Simple rules that flag customers or records that meet certain conditions  
- Produce a short, clear set of recommendations that explain:
  - What you found  
  - What you think the client should do next  

You do not have to reach Tier 3 to have a successful Hackathon. A solid Tier 1 and Tier 2 solution is more useful than a half finished complicated idea.

## How Teams Will Work 🤝

You will work in mixed teams of Software and Data.

Roughly:

- Data focused people might lead on cleaning, validation, exploratory analysis and visualisation  
- Software focused people might lead on building APIs, dashboards, apps and wiring everything together  
- Less confident team members can own testing, documentation, note taking, presentation prep and keeping the client needs in focus  

You will decide as a team how to split the work. The goal is not for one person to do everything, it is for the team to ship something together.


## Tools and Tech 🛠️

You need:

- Your laptop and charger. That is it.  

Use what you already know, for example:

- Python, R or SQL for data work  
- JavaScript, React or similar for front end  
- Node, Python, or another backend for APIs  
- Notebook tools or BI tools for quick visuals  

You are not being judged on your exact tech stack. The focus is on whether you solved the problem in a sensible way and can explain your choices.

## Support During The Day

Facilitators will be around to:

- Unblock you on technical issues  
- Ask awkward client style questions  
- Help you refocus if you get stuck in the weeds  

They will not write your solution for you, but they will help you move forwards.

## Showcase, Judging and Prizes

At the end of the day each team will give a showcase covering:

- What was the problem  
- What you built  
- What you learned  

Awards will include:

- Best Overall Solution  
- Best Data Insight  
- Best Technical Build  
- Audience Favourite  

Each member of the overall winning team gets a £50 Amazon voucher.

## What You Should Aim For 🎯

By the end of the Hackathon, a strong team will be able to:

- Explain the client problem in simple language  
- Show a cleaned, sensible dataset  
- Demo a dashboard, app or tool that a non technical user could understand  
- Talk honestly about trade offs, what worked and what they would do next  

If you can do that, you have had a very good day.

Get your laptop ready, bring your ideas, and be prepared to ship something real in a single sprint.
